	<h2>Progress Report</h2>

	<p>April 9 - April 15 
        <br>In the first week, we wanted to be able to set up the foundation for our engine. We have an OpenGL base that is at minimum able to render at least simple primitives on the screen along with a source build. We also did research on OpenGL based video game engines and real-time lighting / camera effects. We also had a lot of time going into preperation for the miderm. 
        <br> - set up the dependencies: GLEW, GLFW, GLF, and SOIL. 
        <br> - basic window interface, with 2d primitives. 
	<p>
	April 16 - April 22
    <br>We figured out how to set up a movable camera, and basic primitives in a 3D space. We have yet to use SOIL. We hav been considering using FreeType for text rendering. 
    <br> - getting a basic shader
    <br> - set up one light
