	<h1>Title</h1>
	<h4>Ricky Herrera, cs184-abx</h4>
	<h4>Kyle Zhou, cs184-abj</h4>

	<p>real time graphics game engine</p>

	<p>god rays, vignetting, lens flare</p>

	<h2>shadows</h2>

	<p>plan -> real time light / camera effects on materials</p>

	<p>hope -> more physics based mechanics, integrate texture mapping, </p>

	dedication, thorough understanding of physically-based lighting

	hope -> procedurally generated environments

	schedule

	4/9 - 4/15 -> opengl base, source build setup correctly, research opengl based video game engines
	4/16 - 4/22 -> figure out simple operations, how to load meshes and lighting, primitive textures, look into procedurally generating objects
	4/23 - 4/29 -> 
	4/30 - 5/6

	resources
