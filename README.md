# E-Minor Engine
Final project for Berkeley's Computer Graphics and Imaging course CS184 (Spring 2017). The inner machinations of this engine are an enigma. 

To run, follow these steps:<br />
  1) git clone https://github.com/kxqzhou/E-minor-engine.git;<br />
  2) mkdir build (create a build directory) <br />
  3) cmake .. <br />
  4) make <br />
  5) ./eminor <br />

Compiling this project requires several dependencies. Below is a command for Linux machines to retrieve the necessary packages:<br />
sudo apt-get install cmake xorg-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl-dev dos2unix git wget libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libassimp-dev libsoil-dev libfreetype6-dev libglm-dev<br />

To play the game, use the AWSD keys for lateral movement and the mouse to control the angle of view. You can also press 1, 2, or 3 to generate random structures of cubes, being "tree-like", vertical, or horizontal, respectively.<br />
